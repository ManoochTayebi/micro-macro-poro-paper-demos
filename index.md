# Welcome to [Manoochehrtayebi, Bel-Brunon & Genet, Finite strain micro-poro-mechanics: formulation and compared analysis with macro-poro-mechanics, International Journal of Solids and Structures (In Press)]'s demos!

Demos can be browsed statically but also interactivelyâ€”to start a session and run the code just click on the rocket icon at the top of a tutorial page and then click on "Binder".
You can also launch a JupyterLab session with all tutorials: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mgenet/Micro-Macro-Poro-paper-demos/master?urlpath=lab/tree/./demos).
